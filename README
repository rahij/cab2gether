<h2>What this is</h2>
An early version of a HTML5 cab pooling app for Singapore done for a hackathon. This is not properly maintained.

<h2>Building</h2>
Just copy to your localhost/server. Go to /project_folder/cab2gether-client
and edit the server links in index.html as per your file structure.

Cheers,
